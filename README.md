Single compartmental, ball-and-stick models implemented in XPP and full morphological model in Neuron. Paper is in preparation and correlates anatomical properties with electrophysiological recordings from these hard-to-access neurons. For instance we make predictions about location of the spike initiation zone, channel distributions, and synaptic input parameters.

## Requirements:

XPPAUT 5.99 - http://www.math.pitt.edu/~bard/xpp/xpp.html

Neuron 7.1 - http://www.neuron.yale.edu/neuron/

## Directories:

**xpp-models/**	Isopotential and ball-and-stick models.

**neuron-model/** Multicompartmental model in Neuron. Use exp-axon-tail2-chans-ext-axon-70um.ses as the main file.

**NeuroML2/** (*Under Construction*) Ports of all models to NeuroML2 and LEMS. [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/cengique/drosophila-aCC-L3-motoneuron-model.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/cengique/drosophila-aCC-L3-motoneuron-model)

## Workflow/history of project:
- Channel data were fit with the Neurofit tool and then re-adjusted with param-fitter in Matlab.
- XPP models were built with these channels and hand-tuned to fit observed f-I, v-I, and delay.
- Neuron model used these channels and some properties of the ball-and-stick model.
- Morphological reconstruction passive parameters were tuned to recorded capacitance responses.
- Channel distribution hand tuned to mimick observed current responses.
